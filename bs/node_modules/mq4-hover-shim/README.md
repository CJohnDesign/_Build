A shim for the [Media Queries Level 4 `hover` @media feature](http://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#hover).

The CSSWG's [Media Queries Level 4 Working Draft](http://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/) defines a [`hover` media feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover) that can be used in media queries. This can be used to determine whether the user-agent's primary pointing device truly supports hovering (like mice do) (the `hover` value), or emulates hovering (e.g. via a long tap, like most modern touch-based mobile devices) (the `on-demand` value), or does not support hovering at all (like some old mobile devices) (the `none` value). This matters because emulated hovering typically has some ugly quirks, such as [`:hover`](hover-pseudo) being "sticky" (i.e. a hovered element stays in the [`:hover` state](hover-pseudo) even after the user stops interacting with it and until the user hovers over a different element). It is often better to avoid `:hover` styles in browsers where hovering supports is emulated.

However, since it's from a relatively recent Working Draft, the `hover` media feature is not supported in all current modern browsers or in any legacy browsers. So, this library was created to shim support for the feature into browsers that lack native support for it.

NOTE: This shim only adds support for the `hover` value of the `hover` media feature. So you can only tell the difference between "truly supports hovering" (the `hover` value)" and "does not truly support hovering" (the `none` or `on-demand` values).

The shim consists of two parts:
* A [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)-based server-side CSS postprocessor that rewrites
```css
@media (hover: hover) {
    some-selector {
        property: value;
    }
}
```
into
```css
some-prefix some-selector {
    property: value;
}
```
(In normal use-cases, `some-selector` will contain the `:hover` pseudo-class and `some-prefix` will be a specially-named CSS class that will typically be added to the `<html>` element.)
* A client-side JavaScript library that detects whether the user-agent truly supports hovering. When the check returns true, then your code can add the special CSS class to the appropriate element to enable [`:hover`](hover-pseudo) styles; for example:
```js
$(document).on('mq4hsChange', function (e) {
    $(document.documentElement).toggleClass('some-special-class', e.trueHover);
});
```
Obviously, this requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser, and would default to disabling `:hover` styles when JavaScript is disabled.

## Installation

* Via npm: `npm install mq4-hover-shim`
* Via jspm: `jspm install mq4-hover-shim`

## Client-side dependencies

The browser-side portion of the shim depends on jQuery for firing events.

**Pull requests to add support for other browser event libraries would be welcomed.**

## Browser compatibility

The following is a summary of the results of testing the library in various browsers. [Try out the Live Testcase](http://jsbin.com/xekahi/1).

Legend:
* True positive - Browser supports real hovering, and mq4-hover-shim reports that it supports real hovering
* True negative - Browser does NOT support real hovering, and mq4-hover-shim reports that it does NOT support real hovering
* False negative - Browser supports real hovering, and mq4-hover-shim reports that it does NOT support real hovering
* False positive - Browser does NOT supports real hovering, and mq4-hover-shim reports that it supports real hovering
* ??? - This case has yet to be tested.
* Desktop - has a pointing device that supports true hovering (e.g. mouse, trackball, trackpad, joystick, http://xkcd.com/243/); lacks a touch-based pointing input device
* [Laplet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplet) - has both a pointing device that supports true hovering and a touch-based pointing input device
* Mobile - has a touch-based pointing input device (e.g. touchscreen); lacks a pointing device that supports true hovering

Officially supported:

## API
### Node.js module; CSS postprocessor
The npm module has the following properties:
* `postprocessorFor`
  * Arguments: an options object with one property:
    * `hoverSelectorPrefix` - This string will be prepended to all selectors within `@media (hover: hover) {...}` blocks within the source CSS.
      * Type: `string`
  * Side-effects: none
  * Return type: A [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) processor object (that was returned from a call to the `postcss()` function).
  * Returns a CSS postprocessor that transforms the source CSS as described above.
* `featureDetector` - Each of this object's properties is a string filepath to a JavaScript file containing the browser-side feature detector in a particular JavaScript module format.
  * `es6` - [ECMAScript 6 module](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html) format (this is the original from which the other versions are generated)
  * `cjs` - [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) module format
  * `umdGlobal` - "enhanced" [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module format; exports a `window.mq4HoverShim` global if the JS environment has no module system (e.g. if included directly via `<script>` in current browsers); (generated via Browserify's `standalone` option)

### Browser-side feature detector
The browser-side feature detector is available in the following module formats:
* [ECMAScript 6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#modules): [`/src/browser/mq4-hover-shim.js`](https://github.com/twbs/mq4-hover-shim/blob/master/src/browser/mq4-hover-shim.js)
* Raw [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1): [`/dist/cjs/mq4-hover-shim.js`](https://github.com/twbs/mq4-hover-shim/blob/master/dist/cjs/mq4-hover-shim.js)
* [UMD (Universal Module Definition)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) with global fallback: [`/dist/browser/mq4-hover-shim.js`](https://github.com/twbs/mq4-hover-shim/blob/master/dist/browser/mq4-hover-shim.js)
  * When this is used in a non-AMD non-CommonJS context, the module will be exported as a `mq4HoverShim` property on the global `window` object.

The module exports one public function:
* `supportsTrueHover()`
  * Arguments: none
  * Side-effects: none
  * Return type: `boolean`
  * Returns a `boolean` value indicating if the browser's primary pointer currently supports true hovering or if the browser at least does not try to quirkily emulate hovering, such that [`:hover`](hover-pseudo) CSS styles are appropriate.
  * In other words, returns `true` if `@media (hover: hover)` would evaluate to `true` were the browser to natively correctly implement Media Queries Level 4; otherwise, returns `false`.
  * If the browser does not natively support the `hover` media feature, but does support touch via some pointing input device, then we define this touch-based pointer to be the "primary pointer". Hence, if said browser has multiple pointing input devices, one supporting touch and another supporting true hovering (e.g. the computer has both a mouse and a touchscreen), this function will return `false`, since the user could use the touch input device at any time and since `:hover` should only be used for progressive enhancement anyway.

The module has one public event:
* Event name: `mq4hsChange`
  * Fired whenever the primary pointer's support for true hovering changes.
    * This may be due to a different pointer becoming the primary pointer, although that's not the only possible cause.
    * This event isn't fired merely if a different pointer becomes the primary pointer. The new primary pointer must also differ from the old primary pointer in its support for true hovering. For example, switching from one mouse to another mouse, or from one touchscreen to another touchscreen won't cause this event to fire.
  * Target: the `document` object
  * Extra properties:
    * `trueHover`
      * Type: `boolean`
      * Value: Same as `supportsTrueHover()`'s return value at the time of firing the event

## Contributing
The project's coding style is laid out in the JSHint, ESLint, and JSCS configurations. Add unit tests when changing the CSS postprocessor. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Manually test any changes to the browser-side portion of the shim.

_Also, please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!_
